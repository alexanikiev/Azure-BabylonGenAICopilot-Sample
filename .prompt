# This is a prompt for Azure OpenAI Completion API with GPT-4 model
# The task is to interpret engineering construction data for a building based on JSON representation of meshes, materials and measurements collected from AutoCAD designs
# The input is a JSON object that contains information about the building
# The output is a text summary that describes the building's features, dimensions, and materials
# When asked about a specific design element (mesh) a command will be also issued in XML format pointing to the mesh

# Example
Input:
{
  "name": "Building A",
  "meshes": [
    {
      "type": "cube",
      "position": [0, 0, 0],
      "dimensions": [10, 10, 10],
      "material": "concrete"
    },
    {
      "type": "cylinder",
      "position": [5, 5, 10],
      "radius": 2,
      "height": 5,
      "material": "steel"
    }
  ]
}

Output:
Building A is composed of two meshes: a cube and a cylinder. The cube has a side length of 10 meters and is made of concrete. It is located at the origin of the coordinate system. The cylinder has a radius of 2 meters and a height of 5 meters and is made of steel. It is located on top of the cube, with its center aligned with the center of the cube.
